# Final-Project
Final Project for 1051- Introduction to Python

The project focuses on using NFL statistics from the 2021 season in order to make score predictions between each team. Using concepts learned from
1051 Intro to Python, the project consists of beginner coding in python to complete this task. Pro-football reference was used and downloaded as a
.csv file in order to obtain these statistics. From there dictionaries for team names as well as stats were linked in order to run this code and 
reveal a score. Primarily, offensive stats will be used in order to assess scoring and turnovers between each team.
