# Final-Project
Final Project for 1051- Introduction to Python

2021 NFL Score Simulator

Ryan  B Gaspar and Adam Holtsmaster

The project focuses on using NFL statistics from the 2021 season in order to make score predictions between each team. Using concepts learned from
1051 Intro to Python, the project consists of beginner coding in python to complete this task. Pro-football reference was used and downloaded as a
.csv file in order to obtain these statistics. From there dictionaries for team names as well as stats were linked in order to run this code and 
reveal a score. Primarily, offensive stats will be used in order to assess scoring and turnovers between each team. 

Issues when using this code that we came across including accurately aligning the splitting of the .csv file. This became an isssue when referencing 
each team with the accurate stats. Therefore, we used a dictionary to reference the modeled score outcome. We also had an issue coreectly calculating
the score using many different stats therefore, we used our own method of scoring for predictability. Limitations that we found when researching 
includes accurately using pandas. This was something used in many algorithms but we did not know how to use it correctly, therefore we used the knowledge
of what we learned in this class to predict the score. Overall, we wish we could use more stats to make more accurate models, but we are proud that it is
still able to output acccurate scores as referenced in the video. We also enjoy accurately inputing the team name as well as using multiple matchups in the 
same program by continuing with yes or no. 

Any suggestions to build on splitting to align team stats to build upon would be greatly appreciated. This program has potential to be very useful for 
sports betting and modeling score outcomes to maximize profit especially a model template for the 2022 NFL season! Hope you enjoy!
