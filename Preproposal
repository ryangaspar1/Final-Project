# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Our ideas for the final project consist of:
-Creating a sports predictor algorithm that can be used to simulate and predict the winner of a sports game using season average statistics that can be used for sports betting
- Sports could consist of professional basketball, football, hockey, and baseball
- Another idea would be to use a set of DNA and predict its RNA and protein sequences using only exon sequences (1 Letter and 3 Letter Amino acid sequence), not intron sequences
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Which idea would be better? The sports predictor algorithm or the DNA to protein sequences?
